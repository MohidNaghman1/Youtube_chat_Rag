### 🚀 Chat with ANY YouTube Video — The Future is Here! 🎥🤖
Ever wished you could ask a YouTube video a question and get an instant, accurate answer — without scrubbing through hours of content?
Well… now you can! 💥

### ⚡ What I Built
✅ Paste a YouTube link → Ask anything → Get precise answers straight from the video!
No more endless scrolling through tutorials, lectures, or podcasts.
Just chat. Get what you need. Move on.

### 🧠 How It Works — RAG in Action!
This project uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline to make YouTube videos conversational:

1️⃣ Extract — Instantly fetch the full video transcript
2️⃣ Chunk & Embed — Break it into smart pieces and store as embeddings
3️⃣ Retrieve — When you ask a question, find the most relevant parts
4️⃣ Generate — Feed context to an AI model → Get precise, grounded answers (no hallucinations!)

### 🔨 Tech Stack
✨ LangChain — backbone for the RAG pipeline

⚡ FAISS — fast vector similarity search

🤗 Hugging Face Transformers — for natural language generation

🚀 Streamlit — clean, interactive web app frontend

📽️ YouTubeTranscriptAPI — fetches subtitles in seconds

### 🌟 What’s Next
✅ Chrome Extension (coming soon!):
Watch ANY YouTube video → Click → A chat window pops up → Ask anything live while watching!

Goal: Turn every YouTube tab into your personal AI tutor, explainer, or assistant.
